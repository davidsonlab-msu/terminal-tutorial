Introduction to navigating a computer's system files, presented to the Moczek Lab at Indiana University

## Navigating 
- `Up Arrow`: Will show your last command
- `Down Arrow`: Will show your next command
- `Tab`: Will auto-complete your command
- `Ctrl + C`: Will cancel a command
- `~`: Home

## The Essentials

Print your current location:
```bash
pwd
```

List files in your current location (directory):
```bash
ls
```

There are many ways to customize the way in which files are listed.
For example, as a vertical list:

```bash
ls -l
```

... or as a vertical list with human-readable information:

```bash
ls -lh
```

Often it is useful to learn about a command's options. This can be done in two ways:

```bash
man ls
```
```bash
ls --help
```
